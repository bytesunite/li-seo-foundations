# Chapter 3 - Content Optimization for SEO: How Search Engines and People View Webpages
## Lesson 2 - Optimizing Site Structure

A Search Engine will crawl your page to learn how pages relate to each other.<br>
The term "internal linking" is used to describe how pages within your website link to each other.

For example, if you have an e-commerce site you may have a structure that allows visitors to navgate by category, then subcategory, and finally to products.

<pre>
       subcategories - products 1,2,3
        /
categories 
        \
       subcategories - products 1,2,3
</pre>

A website with a poor structure makes it difficult navigate for people and Search Engines. Examples of poor structure include
- links that go to a dead end without a way back
- links to pages that no longer exist
- non descriptive links to mystery pages

There is no right way to build a site structure but it should be clear to you and your visitors. Imagine a pile of books on the floor and trying to find a specific book, versus a bookstore with shelves or books ordered by category and author. It makes a big difference when people can quickly find the content the are looking for on your website.
