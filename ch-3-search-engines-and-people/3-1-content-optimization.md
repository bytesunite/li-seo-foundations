# Chapter 3 - Content Optimization for SEO: How Search Engines and People View Webpages
## Lesson 1 - Outlining content optimization

The term "Content Optimization" is the process of continually improving the quality and relevancy of the words, pictures, and everything else that shows up on your pages.

It is important to understand how both People and Search Engines detemine what is good content.

The instructor has students to look at a webpage, explorecalifornia.org, asking them to determine what the webpage is about. What would you look at?
- We would probably start by looking at the top left which is a graphic of a biker with the golden gate bridge in the background. The text on the image says "explore california".
- Then looking at the menu we can see "Tours- follow our bliss, Mission- what makes us different?, Resources- plan your trip, Explorers- join our community, Contact- we're listening".

At this point we can already guess we are on some travel website about California.
Then, our eyes move down the page 
- a left sidebar shows monthly specials of travel destinations
- finally the main content starts with "Backpack Cali" followed by an image of a landscape and a graphic of some boot prints which also says "Backpack Cali".
- The content talks about backpacking and a "Backpack Cal tour package".
- The main content is followed by a list of tours, retreats, day trip hiking, etc.
- At the bottom of the page is a standard page footer of links that closely match the header in a more condensed fashion.

The instructor then asks students how they would go about finding the best information about "backpacking in California".

If you came back with "A little about us", which is the start of the page title description for "explorecalifornia.org/tours/tour_detail_backpack.html" this would be a disappointment the instructor says. The main heading on the page says "Backpack Cali" and the graphic says "Backpack Cal".<br>
The instructor points out "A little about us", "Backpack Cali" and "Backpack Cal" are NOT the terms that you were supposed to be searching for. So how would you come across this page in the first place if you were searching for "Backpacking in California"?

People and Search Engines expect *clarity* and *quality* from your webpages.<br>
They want to know without any hesitation what your content is all about.

If you found the page and other resources using related keywords other than "Backpacking in California", which is what the instructor asked you to search for. It is not likely you will be asked to search for specific topics again.<br> 
In other words it is hard to trust you will come up with the correct information that was asked for. If instead you came back with lots of related content such a hiking maps & guides, descriptions of California wildlife, packing lists, etc. then this would be a "trusted & relevant" search that people would come back to for searches in the future. A great resource like this is likely to be shared with others.

Search Engines use almost the exact same way as you would to find the correct webpages if they are tasked with the same goal of finding content for "Backpacking in California". It weighs links to your content as trust. So in the previous example of a successful search result with related content that people are sharing has a higher trust and relevance score for a Search Engine.

Keeping your content clear, concise, and relevant will prompt people to share it with others which builds trust. Search Engines look content is the same way, finding trusted and relevant information to a given search.
