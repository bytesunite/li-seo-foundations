# Chapter 4 - Content Optimization: Technical SEO
## Using the Google Page Experience Signal and Core Web Vitals

Google evaluates you website on how secure it is and how quickly it loads. It provides "Core Web Vitals" to help provide insights to help improve accessiblity.

### Google Core Web Vitals
1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)<br>
   The time it takes to render the largest content on the page.
2. First Input Delay (FID)<br>
   How quickly a response is made due to a click or user interaction on the page.
3. Cumulative Layout Shift<br>
   Determines how many components shift around when a user is trying to interact with the page.

You can learn more about how Google determines scores for these topics by reading through the help files.

However, the Google Search Console is only one of many tools to help you gauge the performance of your web pages. Others are listed below.
- PageSpeed Insights
- Chrome DevTools
- Lighthouse
- web.dev Measure tool
- Web Vitals Chrome Extension

This instructor takes a quick look at the *PageSpeed Insights* tool. Here you can measure performance based on both desktop and mobile. A report summary has sections that target different metrics.
- Field data - gauges speed of user interactivity on the page
- Lab Data - which comes from a simulated environment. It also provides insights to improve performance such as keeping request count low, ensure text is visible during webfont loading, etc.

Google uses the Lab Data for ranking purposes. The Lab Data score always comes back lower that the Field Data score. The metrics follow the Google Core Web Vitals topics as mentioned above, (First Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, Largest Contentful Paint, Cumlative Layout Shift)

Back in Google's Search Console tool, lets take a look at "Page Experience".
### Experience - Page Experience
This section provides insights on security, mobile friendly design, reducing delays or blocking content with popups that hinder the user experience, etc.

In Summary, using Googles Search Console tool to explore *Core Web Vitals* & *Page Experience* can go a long way.
- improve ranking & search visibility
- increase speed & performance
- improve security
- enhance the user exerience and usability of your website
