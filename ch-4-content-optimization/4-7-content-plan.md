# Chapter 4 - Content Optimization: Technical SEO
## Lesson 7 - Planning Content Over the Long Term

So far in this course we have covered a lot of things
- mapping keyword phrases to urls, page titles, headings, meta descriptions
- writing content for people before Search Engines
- exploring website structure, creating a sitemap, and internal linking
- using structured data to describe elements for Search Engines
- using tools to help analyze performance, search results

But what about the content itself? It helps to come up with a content strategy.

### Content Strategy
When you put together a website it helps to have a content strategy to help you organize and manage you content.
- Define Business Goals<br>
  This may include sales, leads, downloads, views. These are "key performance indicators" that you want to track to gauge success of you site content.
- Understand your audience<br>
  What problem do they have that you are trying to solve. You may even think about building customer personas to help think like a customer or simulate how visitors may respond to your content

It may help to think about a spreadsheet to manage content
- what content will be created
- when will this content be created
- what keywords will be targeted
- where will the content reside
- who will create and/or maintain the content
- how will this content be promoted
- who will keep track of the progress of this feature/topic

The instructor provides a simple spreadsheet to help illustrate how this may work. Below is a small snippet to help illustrate.

<table style="border:1px solid black">
<thead>
<tr style="background-color:gray"><td colspan="2">Ice Cream Shop Sample Editorial Calendar</td></tr>
<tr style="color:gray"><td>Week of</td><td>Jan 1</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Title            </td><td>  Annual Best Ice Cream Flavors Poll Results</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Location       </td><td>/blog/best-ice-cream-flavors-springfield.html  </td><tr>
<tr><td>  Status         </td><td>in progress  </td><tr>

### Content Creation and Management
Each website has different content but here is a way to get started.
- Leverage different content types<br>
  Beyond blogs and websites, content might include the following.<br>
  For example, videos can be shared in newsletters, social media, or promoted on other internal and external web pages. Good content attracts visitors but also increases shares that improve search results.
  - slideshow presentations
  - images
  - infographics
  - videos
  - podcasts
  - augmented & virtual reality

- Keep up with news, social media, industry groups, and competition<br>
  Is there a topic you can offer expert advice on? Can your predict a trend?

- Leverage Relationships<br>
  Is there a customer or vendor you can interview or podcast with? Is there a blog post to share or promote ideas? Can you share an award or recognition?

- Reuse existing content<br>
  Is there content that can be converted to other formats that are more useful? For example if you wrote a books could you convert that into and article? If you gave a presentation could you convert it to a page of content with a slide show, a blog post, or social media post?


### Execution
Make sure your content is clear and concise.
- Edit for spelling and grammer<br>
  Remember, what you put out there on the web is a reflection of you or your company. It must perfect.
- Put in place policy reputation management rules<br>
  Make sure everyone in your organization maintains a healthy respect for online reputation and management. You have likely see how fast information spreads. If something gets published online it is there forever! Make sure all content is well-crafted and thought out and adheres to all policies for writing and publishing on behalf of the organization.

Planning and managing content is challenging but over the long term your work will pay off with increase visibility across search results and beyond.
