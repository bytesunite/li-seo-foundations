## Lesson 5 - AI for discovery

The recent explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has provided new ways to help perform your duties. In the realm of SEO, Search Engines are incorporating AI into their Search algorithms and Search results. Starting & maintaining SEO campaigns can be very research heavy that requires a lot of time and energy. AI is much faster at SEO research tasks than humans. By leveraging AI through chatbots and virtual assistants, we can make our search optimization efforts more efficient.

There are many chatbots out in the world, but you can find they can help.
### Keyword research<br>
  Creating initial lists of potential keywords, expanding them into long tail phrases and organizing them into themes and categories in necessary. But this takes a lot of time. Chatbots can help with this.<br>
  So how would this work?<br>
  Using an ice cream shop as an example, you could ask the Chatbot, "What are some potential keywords a local ice cream parlor would want to target for SEO?".<br>
  As a result it may spit out a long list (see snippet below).
  1. Product and Service
     - Vegan ice cream [Location/Town/City/State]
     - Gluten-free ice cream [Location/Town/City/State]
     - Organic ice cream [Location/Town/City/State]
     - Gourmet ice cream [Location/Town/City/State]
     - Handcrafted ice cream [Location/Town/City/State]
     - Ice cream sundaes [Location/Town/City/State]
     - Ice cream cones [Location/Town/City/State]
  2. Reviews and Testimonials
     - best ice cream reviews [Location/Town/City/State]
  3. Event Specific and Seasonal
  4. Location Specific

  Then you could ask the Chat bot to organize this list into themes. "Can you organize the following SEO keywords into categories or themes?<br>
  Ice cream shop<br>
  Homemade ice cream<br>
  Ice cream flavors<br>
  Gelato near me<br>
  Artisan ice cream<br>
  Dairy-free ice cream<br>
  Ice cream parlors<br>
  Soft serve ice cream"

  As a result it would attempt to organize the content. (A snippet is below)<br>
  1. Keywords for Unique Selling Points:
     - Locally sources ice cream ingredients
     - Eco-friendly ice cream shop [Location/Town/City/State]
     - Ice cream made from scratch

A good mix of keywords tend to focus the following topics.<br>
Search Intent
- Informational
- Transactional
- Commercial
- Navigational

AI can aid you in the keyword discovery process. You can continue to provide commands to add, remove, categorize, and refine your keywords. It can help you move to the important research steps to better understand relevance, search volume, and competition around each of these keywords.


### Building link visibility
Chatbots can also help with interal and external linking opportunities.

Internal Linking Opportunities
- Anchor text<br>
  It could help find and replace "click here" with meaningful search keywords.
- Internal linking improvements<br>
  You could ask a Chatbot, "Can you provide anchor text and the best internal linking opportunities for seo for the site https://explorecalifornia.org/ and the tours page".<br>
  An example response might be:<br>
  1. Activities Page<br>
     Anchor Text:<br>
     - California adventure activites
     - Guided tours for for [Activity]
     - Activity-based tours in California

     Internal Linking Opportunities:
     - Mention specific tours related to each activity listed and link to the tours page
     - Include a section "Find tours by activity" that links to relavent tours
  
  2. Blog


External Linking Opportunities

- Outreach

An example Chatbot question about external linking might be, "Can you provide me with link building opportunities for this website as well?"<br>
A Chatbot result may be similar to the following (snippet below)
1. Local Tourism Boards and Websites<br>
   Opportunity: Get listed on official tourism and city websites that often link to local businesses.<br>
   Action Steps: Contact the tourism board to be included in their directory. Provide them with content or brochures they can link to from their website.
2. Social Media Influences<br>
   Opportunity: Collaborate with travel influencers who can share your tours with their audience, potentially linking back to your website.


Chatbots can help cut the amount of time and energy you put into creating and generating keywords, improve internal & external linking and find new ways to promote your content.
