# Chapter 5 - Links, Measurement, and AI for SEO
## Lesson 2 - Building Linkds for SEO

Both internal and external links are important to Search Engines.

### Internal Links
How pages are linked within your own site provides the Search Engine with your site structure but it also helps understand topics and themes of the content to find the relative and importance of content.

Types of links
- Navigational Links<br>
  These are links you typically find on every page such as a navigation bar, header & footer. These provide breadcrumb trails to navigate the structure of the site. 
- Contextual Links<br>
  Within the content of the page you might have links to other sections of your site. This helps your visitors find other relative information. The Search Engine will look at the link text and the number of links to a page to help it determine the importance of a specific piece of content.

### External Links
The instructor claims this is a large topic and could easily be a course of its own.

External Link Opportunities include
- Directories<br>
  This is a common way of generating links back to you. However you have to be careful as some are known to be spammy more than helpful. Something to look for is a directory that performs an editorial or review process and only accepts relevant and trusted websites.
- Local Business Directories<br>
  Business directories allow you to submit and manage your information directly with individual Search Engines.
- Trusted Industry Groups<br>
  These are trusted and well-established industry specific groups that maintain member or resource directories unique to specific markets.<br>
  - [Bing Places For Business](https://www.bingplaces.com)
  - [Google Business Profile](https://business.google.com)
- Entice other websites
  The best way of building external link opportunies is to entice other websites to link to your content. When a Search Engine sees a well-known and respected company providing links to your website that is a sure sign of confidence to a Search Engine that your website has relevant and quality content.
- Promote Linking with Other Sites<br>
  - Leverage your Newsletter, blog, & social connections. 
  - Look for others that target the same audience as you.<br>
    Reach out to them and let them know you have content that may be useful to them or their visitors.
  - Leverage social channels<br>
    Don't forget to share content. Use those share buttons to let people know about your website and content.
- Research backlinks for companies that are doing well in Search Results<br>
  Search for a term you would like to rank better for, look at the top results and figure out who is linking to those pages. There are tools that can help with this.
    - [Moz Link Explorer](https://moz.com/link-explorer) allows you to view backlinks for a website to gain insight to sites with high "Domain Authority" & "Page Authority".
- Non profits
  Donations or volunteer work can highlight contributions that link back to you. Non Profits, Education, and Governments sites are considered trustworthy (.org, .edu, .gov)


There are also wrong ways to do things. 
- Don't fall for companies offering hundreds of backlinks<br>
  These companies do shady things to build backlinks and will not end end well.
- Don't trade links with random people<br>
  Trading links with others that have nothing to do with your business or content is not good for your business.
