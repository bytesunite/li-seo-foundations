# Chapter 5 - Links, Measurement, and AI for SEO
## Analyzing Keywords and Links

When measuring SEO efforts, it helps to start by analyzing the *links* and *keywords* that bringing vistors to your website.

Google Analytics is one tool that is helpful. The instructor mentions you can connect Google Analytics with Google Search Console. After you link these tools together you can go to "Aquisition" section in Google Analytics and there is a "Queries" button you can click on to provide an interface with a graphical representation (day, week, year), followed by a list of "keyword searches". Each keyword search query is followed by (clicks, impressions, click through rate, and average position).<br>
You will want to browse through the search query list and focus on where you can improve. A pattern to look for can help you identify where your link shows up in Search results but less people are click on.<br>

Identify areas of improvement: linke shows in search results, but less visitors following the link
- High Impressions
- Low clickthrough rates

To gain insight on what is happening after someone has clicked on a link in the Search Results, go to  "Aquisition - All Traffic - Source/Medium". Unfortunately outside the Search Console reports, search engines do not provide much for organic keyword data to analytics. But we an gain some information about (aquisition, behavior, conversion) metrics to get a sense of how much and what kind of traffic the Search Engine is producing. For example, in "Behavior" you can see bounce rate, which tells you the percentage of visitors that visit one page and leave.<br>
This helps you gauge how engaged your visitors are.<br>
Remember, this data is only for people finding your content via Search Results. It does not show us the keyword phrases that were NOT used.

Exploring backlinks to learn more about how Search Engines are gauging your authorative presence through external links to you can be done using different tools. You can research this for every page of your site.
- Moz
- Majestic SEO
- Ahrefs
- Raven
- Semrush

The instructor shows a basic example of [Moz Link Explorer](https://moz.com/link-explorer). Using the main url for the website you can see it provides you information about how your link building efforts are doing. A quick snapshot is provided to gain an overview of backlinks to individual pages.
- Domain Authority<br>
  The higher the domain authority, the higher value of the rankings
- Linking Domains
- Inbound Links
  Inbound links provide information about where other websites are providing links to your website and individual pages. By exploring this data you may discover that a website has an incomplete or inaccurate description of the page they are linking to. In cases like this you can reach out to them to update the link.<br>
  But you may also discover links on websites you do NOT want to associate with your business and take steps to block them or get them taken down. Both Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster tools provide an interface to address unwanted backlinks.
