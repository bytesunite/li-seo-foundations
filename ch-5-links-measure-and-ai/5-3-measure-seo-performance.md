NOT PART OF COURSE: <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and other tools can help you gain insights into how visitors navigate to your site, as well as how visitors navigate within your site & interact with it. Additionally these tools can track mobile app traffic. Typically a JavaScript script is inserted into the content to help track information. These tools often provide other metrics and services to help you track related data for your website or mobile app. For example, <strong>Google Analytics</strong> can tie into the <a href="https://business.google.com/us/google-ads/">GoogleAds online advertising platform</a>, to help monitor advertising efforts.<br>
Google does a poor job explaining Google Analytics to the common user, so for a quick and friendly overview, read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Wikipedia : Google Analytics</a>
