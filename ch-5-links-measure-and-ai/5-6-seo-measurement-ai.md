### Defining Keyword Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Chatbots can help. Let's try, "The goal of my website https://explorecalifornia.org is to get more people to sign up for more tours. I am focusing on organic traffic. Can you help me develop actionable KPIs for my SEO campaigns?".<br>
The sample response talks about (see snippet below)
- organic conversion rate: calculate the percent of organic visitors that results in sign-ups for tours
- number of organic leads: count the number of leads through organic search
- bounce rate: a high bounce rate indicates a need for better targeting or page optimization
- average session duration: track how long people stay on your site

These results are very broad. So you can continue the conversation with the Chatbot to help you narrow the focus to your site. If you ask, "can you provide more specifics around my website", the result displays more details of features we saw earlier except it provides step by step details on how to use different parts of Google Analytics to perform each task, as well as an explanation of which each section does. This is helpful.
