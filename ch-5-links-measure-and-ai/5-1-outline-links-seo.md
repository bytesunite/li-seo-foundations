# Chapter 5 - Links, Measurement, and AI for SEO
## Lesson 1 - Outlining the Importance of Links for SEO

Search Engines rely heavily on links. Each link is a *vote of confidence* for whatever it points to. But not every link holds the same value. As we learned in previous lessons, a Search engine evaluates *trust* by giving more value or "trust worthiness" to links coming from well known companies and government websites. It comes down to the number of links and quality of links.

Search Engines give a higher vote of confidence to
- Link popularity
- Link quality

The more quality links you have to your site the more the Search Engine with trust you pages enough to recommend them to their users.

For example if a food blog has a link to a recipe, this connection is pretty straight forward and the content is relative to the topic. But if a link to your recipe is placed on your friends pet shop website to increase SEO, this won't work well. The Search Engine will be looking for thematic and relevant content which will not rate this connection very high and it won't help your SEO for a food recipe.

An HTML anchor tag with a clear description will give people a pretty good idea if that is what they are looking for. Many sites make the mistake of using "link" or "click here". These links do not help describe the purpose or content that the link points to. This is an opportunity to use effective keyword phrases to clearly identify it's purpose.
<pre>
EXAMPLE: nondescript links

  "click here" to find out more!

  Here is a great resource "link"!

EXAMPLE: use descriptive text in your links

  Find more <span style="color:green">"California backpacking tips"</span> and enjoy your adventure.
</pre>


Search Engines also pay attention to current content. If you published a website and haven't updated it in awhile a Search Engine might mark it as "stale", giving more weight to new content. Also, you don't want to try to trick the system. If your website is unknown and suddenly a ton of links magically show up on random blogs on the same day this may hint some shady behavior. If hundreds of links magically show up on the same day every month it won't take long for the Search Engine to track down and block a website like this from their search results.

Todays online world is largely social and even if there is no physical link, Search Engines can use shared content to help boost the value of your content.

Good SEO is learning the top keyword phrases that people are searching for and returning valuable content.
