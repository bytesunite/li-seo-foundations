## Lesson 1 - What is Search Engine Optimization?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of making improvements on and off your website in order to gain more exposure in search engine results. This means more visitors finding you for the right reasons.

What are the goals of Search Engines?<br>
Search engines are really just trying to find and understand all the content out there on the Internet and quickly return deliver "relevant" and "authoritative" content.

### 1. Relevance

When you make a search for "california travel" the Search Engine uses an algorithm to search through a huge amount of known websites using the words provided to match "relevant" information in its index of results. It does this by looking at some key factors.
- How is the website written
- How it's implemented in code
- How it is linked

The Search Engine must be able to discern the difference between "california travel" and other searches such as "california resorts", "beach getaways", etc. They are able to determine "semantic" and "thematic" differences. Often searches will return related content to your search.

### 2. Authoritative

In a lawless web where anything can be posted, it helps to know if the content can be trusted. Search Engines often determine "Authority" by evaluating what other websites have to say about a piece of content.

One way a Search Engine determines what others have to say, is "links" to your website from other sites. This can include references, reviews, etc. This tells the Search Engine that if others are willing to point to a site there must be enough trust to do this. You can think of it as a "vote of trust". 

But you might wonder how a Search Engine knows there are links to your site. When the Search Engine crawls the web it indexes how many times your website is referenced which helps improve you site's trust and ranking.

This might seem odd because this sounds like a "popularity contest" more than evaluating useful and valid content. The Search Engine determines "quality & relevance" on predetermined websites that are known to be well known and trusted, such as a government agency, non-profit, or industry leading blog. For example, if you have a California travel website it would serve you well to have links from the chamber of commerce & local travel bureaus than some sketchy unknown site. It's less the number of links but more the quality of links from well known and trusted websites that will improve you website search results.
