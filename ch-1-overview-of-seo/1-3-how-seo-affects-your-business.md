## Lesson 3 - How SEO Affects Your Business

An effective SEO strategy will cost **time** and **money**.<br>
When done well, SEO can help you reach a large audience and attract targeted visitors that will provide measurable positive results.

### Intent
The motivation behind a search is known as "intent". Marketing research is heavily based on finding the best way to market their products based on common search words that people are searching for. As a marketing professional it is easy to understand what people want when they search for "hiking trails in california" & "where to buy a digital camera". This means that "intent-driven" traffic is a key SEO strategy to generate targeted content. It is also possible to measure your results.

### SEO takes time
But a good SEO strategy takes time. Successful SEO is not something that happens overnight. Search Engines take time to crawl and update what they think of your content. This means you have a lot of work ahead of you to build trust and gain attention to your website and products.
