## Lesson 2 - Reading Search Engine Results Pages

Before learning how to optimize for SEO, let's first look at Search Engine results. There are different Search Engines available but they have similarities.

### Paid Listings
Paid listings are different from natural listings. These "paid listings" are advertisements that people pay companies such as Google to promote a website based on keywords that the company provides to gain exposure. These listings are typically marked as "Ad" at the top or side of other search results.

### Natural or Organic Listing
A natural listing typically consist of 3 parts
- URL of the website
- Title of the company or website
- A brief description

Search engines are not limited to website links. Often things like images, videos, maps, etc. can be searched for and displayed as a list or results as well. Based on the search you may also see Wikipedia in the results which provides details about a specific topic in your search.
