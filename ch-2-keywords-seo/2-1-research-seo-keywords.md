# Chapter 2 - Keywords: The Foundation of SEO
## Lesson 1 - Planning and Researching Your SEO Keywords

It is important to understand what words and phrases users are typing into Search Engines. You can then optimize your SEO effectiveness by targeting these keywords.

You can target keywords based on
- Relevance
- Search volume
- Competition

### Relevance
You can start by brainstorming a list of keywords by asking yourself a few questions...
- What products or services do you offer?
- What problems do you solve?

You can also think about what words or phrases you would type in a Search Engine to find a product or service. But you must understand that people outside that business that are not as familiar with your business as you are use different words and phrases.

For example, if you have a local ice cream shop, you might write down very specific descriptions of a product such as "fruit and flavor-infused dairy-based frozen desserts and confections", it is not likely someone looking for "ice cream shop near me" will match your description. 

Another example might be using the phrase "ice cream". This seems like the simplest and best phrase. You might be surprised to learn this search is NOT that relevant. But this general search phase could match anything from how ice cream was invented, how it is made, and many other reasons.

There are tools available to help you brainstorm about potential search keywords.

### Search Volume
Once you have brainstormed on relevant words and phrases the next step is to look at "search volume". You may notice that the most obvious keywords get typed in THOUSANDS of times every day. These are very competitive as you are fighting everyone else using these same words and phrases. 

### Competition
Using keywords with a high search volume can be very competitive. However, there are some search phrases that are helpful that may not be as competitive. The term "Long tail keywords" are keyword phrases that are more descriptive and less competitive.

Although *long tail keywords* in SEO may not have the most searches, collectively they can be very helpful.

Let's try this out. Go to [Moz Keyword Explorer](https://moz.com/explorer) and type in "iphone cases". Everyone knows this phrase so you will see proof of this with something like 39.5k searches per month for this phrase. It also provides a scale of difficulty based on ranking the top 10 spots, which is about 42 or moderate.<br>
As a comparison, try entering a *long tail keyword* search of "protective iphone cases" and you should see around 400 searches per month and a difficulty scale of around 35 or low. This is a big difference between 39.5k and 400 searches.

Researching and finding a good *long tail keywords* may results in a better SEO solution than a high volume keyword. As a result there is less competition than the most popular searches. Here are a few examples of long tail keywords:

<table style="border:1px solid">
<thead style="background-color:gray">
  <tr>
    <td>Keyword</td>
    <td>Monthly Volume</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>protective iphone cases</td>
    <td>395</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>best iphone cases</td>
    <td>5,605</td>
  <tr>
    <td>iphone protective cases</td>
    <td>546</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>best iphone case for protection</td>
    <td>73</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Keyword Categorization
Next you can start thinking about theming your keywords, known as "keyword categorization". For example you could use "protective iphone cases" combined with different models of the iphone such as "protective iphone 13 cases", 13 pro max, etc. You could do the same with colors such as "blue protective iphone cases", red, green, etc.

Try to be open minded and think about the client's mindset. Try to find the best balance of
- relevance
- search volume
- competition
