## Lesson 2 - Analyzing SEO Keywords and Leveraging Keyword Attributes

In the last lesson we explored key topics of SEO, which included balancing "relevance", "search volume", and "competition".

There are many tools available to research keywords and collection data you can use. Here is a list of some of those tools.
- [Moz Keyword Explorer](https://moz.com/explorer)
- [Keywords Everywhere](https://www.keywordseverywhere.com)
- [SpyFu](https://www.spyfu.com/)
- [Advanced Web Ranking](https://www.advancedwebranking.com/) Keyword Suggestions
- [Ahrefs Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
- [Semrush Keyword Magic](https://www.semrush.com/features/keyword-magic-tool/)

As with most tools you will likely need to signup to use the tools.

One tool is "Moz Keyword Explorer". The instructor walks through using this tool to find keyword search suggestions. 

1. The search term "iphone cases" is entered. Click the "analyze" button.
   This will present an overview of "Keyword Suggestions" & "SERP Analysis"
2. Click on "Keyword Suggestions". This will show you a list of related keywords with a relevancy meter and estimated monthly search volume.
3. There is Volume slider to adjust keywords suggestions based on monthly search volume. The instructor drags this to 0-1.7k to lower the volume to show lower volume search suggestions.
4. After finding some good keyword suggestions you can go back to the overview page. This is where you will find details such as monthly volume estimates, difficulty, and priority. The "priority" scale is 0-100 where the higher score rates the best balance between a higher search volume & lower difficulty.

Most tools will allow you to download the raw data to aid you in your research.

Another tool is *Google Trends*. Here you can type in search keywords and gain information about search keywords over time, geography such country or state, categories, and more. The instructor uses the keywords "iphone cases" and a graph shows spikes at certain times over a 5 year period, which fall around the holidays and back to school. But it also shows a downward trend in overall searches. <br>
This tool provides a "related queries" section that lets us compare search keywords such as comparing "iphone cases" with "iphone 11 case" and "iphone case". In the example the graph shows the highest is "iphone case", followed by "iphone cases", and a much lower "iphone 11 case". This is also reflected in a map of the U.S. that shows the whole map a color that matches the color assigned to "iphone case".

These tools are part of discovering and leveraging keywords for your SEO strategy. It help you find the best balance of "relevance", "search volume", and "competition"
