# Chapter 2 - Keywords: The Foundation of SEO
## Lesson 3 - Mapping SEO Keyword Distribution and Continually Evaluating

The term "Keyword Distribution" is the process of assigning keywords to specific pages on your website.

Keyword Distribution is part of the content creation process to make sure the content on the page aligns with & is relevant to the keywords you are targeting. Once you have researched keywords you generate a list of all the pages in your website and try to match them with your keywords. You may need to create additional pages to match up with your keywords.

The instructor shows a spreadsheet of a site structure with the keywords, url, &lt;title> that uses a Meta title of 65 characters, & &lt;meta-description> of 156 characters.<br>
Below is a small subset to illustrate the spreadsheet, there are many more pages not shown.

<table style="border:1px solid gray;">
<thead style="background-color:gray">
  <tr>
    <td>somedomainname.com</td>
    <td>keywords</td>
    <td>url</td>
    <td>&lt;title&lt&gt; 65 characters</td>
    <td>&lt;meta-description&gt; 156 characters</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>home</td>
    <td>ice cream shop near [area]</td>
    <td>/</td>
    <td>meta title</td>
    <td>meta description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>desserts</td>
    <td>best ice cream in [area]</td>
    <td>/best-ice-cream-in-[area]</td>
    <td>meta title</td>
    <td>meta description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cones</td>
    <td>ice cream cones near [area]</td>
    <td>/best-ice-cream-in-[area]/ice-cream-cones-[area]</td>
    <td>meta title</td>
    <td>meta description</td>
  </tr>

Using a spreadsheet like this is just one example to help you map keywords to page content. This process can be broken down into the following steps.
1. List out existing content pages. Home, contact, about, etc.
2. Match keywords to pages. Do your best to use one keyword per page without duplication
3. Identify where new content is needed. Search Engines perfer unique and relevant content. You can also optimize your existing pages to more closely match your keywords.
4. Keyword research, mapping, and evaluation, is an ongoing process. You will need to revist this process to optimize your site.
5. Measure and adapt. If you monitor your site and have many lookers and no buyers, look at changes you can make.
6. Use paid search to evaluate keywords. Use Google Ads, or Microsoft advertising is one way to determine if you keywords are effectively reaching your clients.
